🛡️ Defensive Communication Security Toolkit

Defending Communication Systems Against Metadata Leaks & Covert Channels

📖 Overview

This project is a defensive cybersecurity toolkit designed to protect communication systems from two critical threats often exploited in espionage and intelligence operations:

Metadata Leaks – Hidden data in files, emails, and documents (e.g., EXIF, email headers, PDF properties) that can unintentionally reveal sensitive information.

Covert Channels (Steganography) – Hidden messages embedded inside images, audio, or documents used for secret data exfiltration.

The toolkit provides:

A Metadata Scrubbing Proxy: Removes sensitive metadata before transmission.

A Defensive Steganography Scanner: Detects suspicious hidden content in media and files.

A Visualization Dashboard: Logs and displays threats detected and mitigated.

This project demonstrates both defensive engineering and forensic analysis of communication systems.

⚡ Features

✔️ Metadata Leak Prevention

Strips EXIF data from images

Removes hidden properties from PDFs/DOCX

Sanitizes email headers (Received paths, X-Mailer, IPs)

✔️ Covert Channel Defense (Steganalysis)

Detects hidden messages in images (LSB analysis, chi-square test)

Flags anomalies in audio files (frequency domain analysis)

Identifies suspicious formatting in PDFs

✔️ Visualization Dashboard

Displays logs of scrubbed files

Shows steganography detection alerts

Supports search & filtering

✔️ Forensic Reports

Logs “before vs after” metadata stripping

Records detection events with timestamps
