# 🛡️ Defensive Communication Security Toolkit  
**Defending Against Metadata Leaks & Covert Channels**

---

## 📖 Overview
This project provides a **two-layer defensive system** to protect communication channels from common espionage threats:  

1. **Metadata Leak Prevention System (MLPS)**  
   - Scrubs sensitive metadata from files, emails, and documents before transmission.  
   - Prevents adversaries from extracting operational security (OPSEC) details such as device info, geolocation, software versions, and communication patterns.  

2. **Defensive Steganography Scanner (DSS)**  
   - Detects hidden data embedded in images, audio, and documents (steganography).  
   - Protects against covert exfiltration techniques often used in cyber-espionage.  

Together, these tools provide a **defensive shield for secure communications** against adversarial intelligence collection.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Prevent **metadata-based intelligence gathering**.  
- Detect and mitigate **covert communication channels**.  
- Provide a **dashboard for operators** to monitor communication artifacts and ensure they are sanitized before release.  
- Demonstrate **practical defensive measures** in the field of communication cybersecurity.
