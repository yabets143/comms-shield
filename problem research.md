# image metadata
## Image metadata categories
Image metadata is often divided into three main categories:

Technical metadata is mostly generated automatically by the device or software that creates the image. 
For example, if the image is a photograph taken by a digital camera, the camera typically generates metadata about the camera and the photo's settings



Descriptive metadata is mostly added manually using special software such as GIMP or Affinity Photo. The individual who creates or manages the image can use the software to add or edit the descriptive metadata. 




Administrative metadata is like descriptive metadata with most of the metadata information added manually using special software. The metadata might include usage and licensing rights, restrictions on reuse or contact information for the image owner. 

## Image metadata formats
Various standardized formats are used to store image metadata. Here are the most common ones:

**Exchangeable Image File (EXIF or Exif)**. The EXIF format is used extensively in digital cameras, smartphones and other devices when generating image metadata.

**Information Interchange Model (IIM)**. The metadata in IIM provides individuals and organizations with a way to add details to images such as titles, genres, instructions, owners or creators, location and contact information, copyright and attribution specifications, and similar types of information. 
**International Color Consortium (ICC)**. This metadata includes details about the color profile embedded in an image. 
**Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP)**. The metadata is an XML-based format or file labeling technology that can accommodate a wide range of meaningful information about an image. The metadata can be embedded into the image file when the image is being created. 

**Digital Negative (DNG)**. DNG is Adobe's metadata format for digital photography. It is a publicly available archival format for raw digital files that is supported by numerous camera vendors and software developers. 

Examples of visual metadata include the following:

- File type and size.
- Description.
- Date created.
- Camera settings.
- Creator and uploader.
- Relevant keywords.
- Expiration date.
- Licensing details.
- Restrictions on use.
- Rights management information.
