# image metadata
## Image metadata categories
Image metadata is often divided into three main categories:

Technical metadata is mostly generated automatically by the device or software that creates the image. 
For example, if the image is a photograph taken by a digital camera, the camera typically generates metadata about the camera and the photo's settings



Descriptive metadata is mostly added manually using special software such as GIMP or Affinity Photo. The individual who creates or manages the image can use the software to add or edit the descriptive metadata. 




Administrative metadata is like descriptive metadata with most of the metadata information added manually using special software. The metadata might include usage and licensing rights, restrictions on reuse or contact information for the image owner. 

## Image metadata formats
Various standardized formats are used to store image metadata. Here are the most common ones:

**Exchangeable Image File (EXIF or Exif)**. The EXIF format is used extensively in digital cameras, smartphones and other devices when generating image metadata.

**Information Interchange Model (IIM)**. The metadata in IIM provides individuals and organizations with a way to add details to images such as titles, genres, instructions, owners or creators, location and contact information, copyright and attribution specifications, and similar types of information. 
**International Color Consortium (ICC)**. This metadata includes details about the color profile embedded in an image. 
**Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP)**. The metadata is an XML-based format or file labeling technology that can accommodate a wide range of meaningful information about an image. The metadata can be embedded into the image file when the image is being created. 

**Digital Negative (DNG)**. DNG is Adobe's metadata format for digital photography. It is a publicly available archival format for raw digital files that is supported by numerous camera vendors and software developers. 

Examples of visual metadata include the following:

- File type and size.
- Description.
- Date created.
- Camera settings.
- Creator and uploader.
- Relevant keywords.
- Expiration date.
- Licensing details.
- Restrictions on use.
- Rights management information.


# Email metadata

 The header of your email contains information such as the sender’s address, receiver’s address, subject, and date. An email header also contains technical information such as the Return-Path, Reply-To Field, and Message-ID. Email headers are specific pieces of data that include critical information for mail delivery.


 From: The sender’s information is contained in this field.

To: This displays the recipient’s name and email address, as well as any email addresses in the CC (carbon copy) and BCC (blind carbon copy) boxes.

Subject: This refers to the title or topic that the sender specifies in the subject line.

Return Path: The return path is a mandatory field that contains the email address to which the system responds. If no reply-to address is specified, it will be used as the address for recipients to respond to.

Reply-To: This is an optional field that contains the address to which recipients should respond.

Envelope-To: This line indicates that an email was sent to the address shown.

Received: This indicates that the recipient’s email address is real and cannot be falsified. It also displays all of the addresses that the email travelled through on its way from one computer to the next.

DomainKeys and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM): These assist email providers in identifying and authenticating emails by connecting the domain name to the email.

Message-ID: Here is the message ID is a unique identifier of letters and numbers.

MIME version: Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) is an internet standard that enhances the format and functionality of email messages. MIME allows films, pictures, and other files to be attached to an email.

Content-type: This field indicates whether the email was written in plain text or HTML. When you have an image or video, it will also appear.

Message body: The major material of an email is displayed in this field.

Email metadata is the hidden information automatically attached to an email message, including:
Sender and recipient details: Names, email addresses, CC/BCC lists. 
Timestamps: Date, time, and time zone of creation and sending. 
Routing information: Paths and server details the email travels through. 
Device and software information: Details about the device and software used to create or send the email. 


## Risks Associated with Email Metadata
Exposed email metadata presents several risks: 
Privacy Violations: Direct PII like author names, email addresses, and geolocation data can be revealed, potentially leading to identity theft. 
Targeted Cyberattacks: Cybercriminals can exploit metadata to gather threat intelligence, map an organization's network, and create highly convincing spear-phishing emails. 
Social Engineering: Metadata provides context for social engineering attacks, allowing malicious actors to impersonate individuals with greater authority. 
Vulnerability Discovery: Revealing software versions and internal processes can help attackers find and exploit security vulnerabilities. 
HIPAA/Regulatory Violations: When sensitive health information is present in metadata, its exposure can lead to regulatory fines and legal repercussions. 
Reputational Damage: Data breaches resulting from metadata exposure can damage an organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
